## Getting Started
1. Install Yarn for dependency management.
```
$ npm install --global yarn
```
2. Install the project dependencies.
``` 
$ yarn
```
3. Start the React application. Changes made to the source code will be reflected in the application automatically via hot reloading.
``` 
$ yarn start
```

## Linting
This project makes use of the Typescript compiler, ESLint and Prettier for static code analysis.
Before making any commits, run the linter via:
```
$ yarn lint
```
This will check for type errors, enforce code formatting, as well as flag out bad practices in the code.
Some lint errors can be auto-corrected by running:
```
$ yarn lint --fix
```
